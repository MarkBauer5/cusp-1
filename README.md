# cusp
Library of CUDA Kernels for Signal Processing

## Introduction
Access to signal processing and mathematical routines implemented in Python has been implemented in several solid libraries (cuPy, cuSignal), but utilizing this functionality from c++ applications such as GNU Radio which uses its own memory management has proved challenging.  The purpose of cusp (CUDA Signal Processing) is to provide a library of CUDA kernels that are wrapped in a manner that is easily callable from c++.  This library is analogous to VOLK but with CUDA hardware acceleration.
